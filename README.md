# Snake Game

This is a simple game created using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), and inspired by the Snake Xenzia game released and popularized on Nokia mobile phones in late 2000s and 2010s.

It is based on the Snake Game tutorial by [Clear Code](https://github.com/clear-code-projects), with additional feature updates added by me.
